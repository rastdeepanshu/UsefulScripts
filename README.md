# Useful scripts

Some python scripts which might be useful:

##### 1.) IMDB top 250 based of rating + number of votes

IMDB 250 movies are great and IMDB has their own formula to calculate the rating.
But actually the ranks should be defined on the average rating and the number of votes.

This script scrapes IMDB 250 movies and rates them on the basis of ratings & number of votes.

```
python imdb-top-movies.py
